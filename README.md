# uDesign Backend

Built using the django_rest framework

WIP

To run it locally:

You need to have python installed.

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

now copy the secrets.env.template file and rename it to remove the .template

This is the setup done, optionally you can also create a superuser.

`python manage.py createsuperuser`

Now you can run the project:

`python manage.py runserver`
